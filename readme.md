<h2>Online WYSWYG (What You See Is What You Get) Text Editor</h2>
This web app can be used to create and edit documents using features like bullets, bold, italic, font_color etc.

<h2>How it works ?</h2>
A DIV tag is used as a textpad by making it editable by setting its Contenteditable property to true. This exposes the execCommand function which is used to change   properties of selected text and to insert html elements like image and links  when the corresponding buttons are pressed
